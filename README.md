# About

Code Golf Scotland is a monthly code golf challenge aimed at Scottish programmers, though all are welcome to take part.

## How to take part

Each month a gist will be created with details on that month's task.

In order to take part post a comment on the gist. The comment should contain your solution to the task,
the language your solution is written in, and the length in characters of your solution.

The comment should follow the same format as the example solution below.

Feel free to use any coding language to solve the task.

## Solution requirements

Your solution should be wrapped in a callable function.

For example `function x($a){return array_sum($a);}` is a valid solution. Whereas `array_sum($a);` is not a valid solution.


## Getting the length of your solution

When getting the length of your solution exclude indentation and newlines from the character count. 

You should include function definitions.

## Example Solution


__Language__: JavaScript

__Length__: 32

__Solution__:

    function foo() { return 'bar'; }
